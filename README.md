# Multivariate-Analysis-for-Particle-Discrimination

We present rigorous analytical comparisons among a series of MVA algorithms for particle identification. 

Dataset used:
The project is based on the MiniBooNE dataset, which is commonly used to discriminate between electron neutrinos and muon neutrinos. 

Algorithmic techniques used:
The algorithms utilize a variety of techniques, including BDTs, ANNs and KNN, to identify particles with a high degree of accuracy.

Results:
The highest degree of purity and efficiency we have achieved is 92% and 95% on the dataset using Boosted Decision Trees, which is a significant improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods. We believe that our methods can be generalized to other datasets and domains with similar success.
